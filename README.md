# python-automation

This repository was created to document three beginner automation projects using Python in order to practice more real world use for this programming language.  

## Objective

My main objective with these simple projects is to learn the following topics:

- Real world use case for Python
- Standard libraries
- Interaction with APIs

## Projects

- Multi-Clipboard

A Clipboard is an area where something we copied (Ctrl + C) is stored, but this area is limited to one item only, because when you copy another item, the most recent copy overrides the previous ones. The idea behing the Multi-Clipboard is to allow us to store multiple things on your clipboard, instead of only the last copied item.

### Instructions

Inside your terminal, in the correct directory, you must start the python script with the correct command to use it.

To start the script, use the following command:

```txt
python multi-clipboard.py <param>
```

The `<param>` bit reffers to the parameters that you can use within the program.

Those parameters are:

- Save

Asks for a Key that will save whatever data that is currently in your clipboard. With this Key you can get whatever is saved under it.

- List

Lists all the diferent clipboard items and their respective Keys saved in your application.

- Load

Inputs the desired Key, and Loads the data saved with it to your PC clipboard.

- Weather API
- Send an Email

## Credits

All three project ideas were presented by [Tech With Tim](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4JX40jDee_tINbkjycV4Sg). He is an amazing content creator, and I'd definitely recommend his channel if you're interested in Python!
