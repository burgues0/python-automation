# python-automation

This repository was created to document three beginner automation projects using Python in order to practice more real world use for this programming language.  

## Objective

My main objective with these simple projects is to learn the following topics:

- Real world use case for Python
- Standard libraries
- Interaction with APIs

## Projects

### Multi-Clipboard

A Clipboard is an area where something we copied (Ctrl + C) is stored, but this area is limited to one item only, because when you copy another item, the most recent copy overrides the previous ones. The idea behing the Multi-Clipboard is to allow us to store multiple things on your clipboard, instead of only the last copied item.

#### Instructions

Inside your terminal, in the correct directory, you must start the python script with the correct command to use it.

To start the script, use the following command:

```txt
python multi-clipboard.py <args>
```

The `<args>` bit reffers to the parameters that you can use within the program.

Those parameters are:

- -p [key]

Asks for a Key that will paste whatever data that is currently in your clipboard. With this Key you can get whatever is assigned to it.

- -l

Lists all the diferent clipboard items and their respective Keys saved in your application.

- -c [key]

Inputs the desired Key, and copies the data saved with it to your PC clipboard.

- -d [key]

Deletes the item in the clipboard that reffers to the specified key.
