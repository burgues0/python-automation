# python-automation

This repository was created to document three beginner automation projects using Python in order to practice more real world use for this programming language.  

## Objective

My main objective with these simple projects is to learn the following topics:

- Real world use case for Python
- Standard libraries
- Interaction with APIs

## Projects

- Multi-Clipboard
- Weather API
- Send an Email

## Credits

All three project ideas were presented by [Tech With Tim](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4JX40jDee_tINbkjycV4Sg). He is an amazing content creator, and I'd definitely recommend his channel if you're interested in Python!
